After spending those 30 flight hours + 5 more in airports transits we arrived at Auckland, but it wouldn't be the first city to visit because we needed to take another flight to Christchurch, where we definitely started our road trip.

Auckland didn't give us a warm welcome, wind and rain everywhere. Also, we couldn't imagine how it will welcome us again in the next visit. Apart from that, we didn't have luck with our last flight of the day, we lost the connection to Christchurch with JetStar and we needed to buy other tickets but this time with Air New Zealand, and yes, another hour inside a plane :smile:. _0_

Christchurch landing was totally different, another feeling, the weather was calm, no rain but dark grey sky. Our first mission was to pick up our "egg", yes, the campervan, a small Mazda van from [Wendekreisen](https://www.wendekreisen.co.nz/campervans/campervan.aspx?VehID=22) company, they called it Koru 2. It had "kitchen (fridge included), "shower" and a desk convertible to bed, all luxury! In any case, we rent it with too many unnecessary extras, like the TV or the DVD, we didn't make use of them in the entire trip, but anyway, it was very well equipped.

We watched a pair of videos about how to drive by the left side and we started our trips for knowing more about that city. We parked close to the old Christchurch cathedral destroyed by 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. It is true it took us more than usual because change gears with the left hand is not an easy job. Curious fact, close to the old cathedral, some blocks away, they built a provisional church, made of recycled materials (cardboard tubes of a carpet factory, ship containers...) and of course it can resist earthquakes._5_

After that, while we were starting a nice relationship with our new GPS, we made our first food shopping, only for surviving the first days. We tried to visit the [Smart Mall](http://www.restart.org.nz/), a mall where the shops are ship containers. That's when we realized the difference with Spain about the schedules, at 5pm shops were closed._10_

We were ready to leave Christchurch, bounding for Tekapo lake, for spending the night there. Around 250km, but 3 hours of trip, there isn't any highway or something. It was late, and jet lag started to hit badly. But Laura took the egg in the middle of the trip and completed the challenge (while Javier was fighting against himself for not sleeping).

_40_ The only problem was we didn't know where to sleep. We didn't reserve anything in advance and we didn't do it ever, for a campervan. So, we ended up in McGregor lake shore, in a [overnight campervan site](https://www.rankers.co.nz/experiences/6394-Lake_McGregor_Overnight_Campervan_Parking) where night cost only 5$ per person. There was no electricity but it had some nice restrooms. We had a bit of could at night, that is true, but it was worth it because we were in a [dark sky international reserve](https://mackenzienz.com/scenic-highlights/dark-sky-reserve-2/), there is almost no light pollution so it is one of the best places in the world to observe the stars._100_
